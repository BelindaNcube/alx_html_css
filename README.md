# headphones - A Responsive Landing Page

This project is a comprehensive front-end development exercise to build a responsive landing page for a fictional **"Headphones"** product, entirely from scratch, based on a provided Figma design.

The goal is to implement a pixel-perfect, accessible, and fully responsive website without using any external CSS frameworks (like Bootstrap) or libraries.

## ðŸš€ Project Goals

* **Pixel-Perfect Implementation:** Match the provided Figma design for both desktop and mobile views.
* **Responsiveness:** Implement a fully responsive layout using media queries, primarily targeting a mobile view at screen widths of **480px or less**.
* **Best Practices:** Adhere to modern web development standards, including:
    * Using a **CSS Reset**.
    * Leveraging **CSS Variables** for maintainability.
    * Employing **simple, generic CSS selectors** for low specificity.
    * Ensuring **accessibility** (`aria-*` attributes, semantic HTML) where applicable.
* **Interactions:** Implement required hover/active states for links and buttons.
* **No External Frameworks:** All styling is achieved with custom HTML and CSS.
* **Vanilla JavaScript:** Implement a mobile hamburger menu using only vanilla JavaScript (Task 8).
* **Pure CSS Graphics:** Replicate the pentagon background image in the "Our results" section purely with HTML/CSS (Task 6).
